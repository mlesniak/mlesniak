# Hello,World

I'm Dr. Michael Lesniak, a polyglot software engineer and software architect with many years of experience in different software development
roles such as senior, staff and principal engineer, architect, team lead and CTO, focusing on software architecture and design,
Java, Kotlin, Go, Clean Code, distributed systems and a track record of successful projects in miscellaneous domains. In
addition, I play around with lots of topics, e.g. programming languages (Rust, Clojure, Zig, ...) or concepts (graphics,
programming languages, algorithms...).

## Interesting repositories

This is my GitHub account and contains a lot of playground projects about different topics
